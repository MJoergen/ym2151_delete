# Notes about jotego's implementation.

Since I'm often comparing to the implementation in
[jotego/jt51](https://github.com/jotego/jt51/), I find it worthwhile to write
some notes / comments.

The following notes apply to the situation after the following sequence of
register writes:

```
20 c7    # Mode 7
28 4a    # Note A4 (440 Hz)
40 01    # MUL
60 00    # Total attenuation level
80 1f    # Attack Rate
a0 00    # Decay Rate
e0 ff    # Release Rate
08 08    # Key ON
```

## Frequency calculation
The signal pg\_phase\_X leaving the u\_pg module is 10 bits wide. This comes
from the upper 10 bits of a 20 bits wide phase signal ph\_X. Likewise there is
a corresponding 20 bits wide phase incremenent phase\_step\_VII, which is added
to the phase at a rate of 3579545/2/32 = 55.93 kHz (because the signal cen is
only asserted every second clock cycle).

When playing a 440 Hz signal the increment is 0x02038 = 8248, which is
equivalent to 440/55930\*2^20.

The address phinc\_addr\_III (10 bits) into the u\_phinctable is 0x280, which
consists of the four bits 1010 from the key code appended with the 6 fraction
bits, which are all zero. The value read out in phinc\_III (12 bits) is 0x80E,
which corresponds to the frequency of the A2 note, i.e. 440 / 4 = 110 Hz.

## Logsin calculation
The signal ph\_phase\_X entering the u\_op module is, as previously stated, 10
bits wide.  Using symmetries it is converted to 8 bits in the signal aux\_X,
which is then fed into the logsin table lookup with the result in the logsin
signal (12 bits).

The actual function calculated is
logsin = -log2(cos((aux+0.5)/256\*pi/2))\*256.
For example the input aux\_X = 0xCB gives the output logsin = 0x1A9.

## Exp calculation
Then the signal atten\_internal\_XI (which is 12 bits wide) is fed into the exp
table lookup with the result in the op\_XIII signal (which is 13 bits wide).

The actual function calculated is
op\_XIII = 2^13 \* exp(-ln(2)\*atten\_internal\_XI/256).
For example, the input atten\_internal\_XI = 0x1A9 gives the output op\_XIII =
0x0A18.
